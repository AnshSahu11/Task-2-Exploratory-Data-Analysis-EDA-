ðŸ›³ Titanic Dataset â€“ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project performs an in-depth exploratory data analysis on the Titanic dataset to uncover patterns related to passenger survival. It demonstrates data cleaning, feature engineering, and visualization techniques using Python libraries such as Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib.

ðŸ“‚ Dataset Source
Kaggle Titanic Dataset

ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

Understand the structure and quality of the dataset
Identify key features influencing survival
Visualize relationships between variables
Engineer new features for deeper insights

ðŸ§° Tools & Libraries

Python 3.x
Pandas
NumPy
Seaborn
Matplotlib
Jupyter Notebook

ðŸ§ª Key Steps
1. Data Loading & Inspection  
Loaded CSV file using Pandas
Inspected data types, missing values, and basic statistics

3. Data Cleaning
Handled missing values in Age, Cabin, and Embarked
Converted categorical variables to numerical formats

3. Feature Engineering
Created FamilySize from SibSp + Parch
Extracted Title from Name
Binned Age and Fare into categories

4. Visualization
Survival rate by gender, class, and embarkation point
Distribution plots for age and fare
Heatmap of feature correlations

5. Insights
Females had a significantly higher survival rate
Passengers in 1st class were more likely to survive
Children and passengers with smaller families had better odds
